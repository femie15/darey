# WEB SOLUTION WITH WORDPRESS

Spin-up 2 server, one for wordpress web server and the other for MySQL database server, note the availability zones of the servers.

Goto volumes and create 3 volume instances and attach them to the web-server.

then we can do `lsblk` on our terminal to view the attached volumes and `df -h` to view all mounts and free space on the server.

use command `gdisk /dev/xvdf` to initiate the partition process. it gives a prompt and we type `n` for new partition 

we then respond `1` for just a single partition (we can have more that 1, based on preference).

we then press enter twice to use up the whole space available

the current type of the system is usually "linux filesystem" we need to change to logical volumes by selecting (typing) `8e00` 
and then `p` to view what we have configured so far.

we then use `w` to write and confirm the command with a yes `Y`,

at this stage, it should show us that the operation is successfull.
